# Sandbox and Computer-Use Security

Naikaku treats computer control as a privileged capability. The default posture is sandbox-first and approval-first.

## Executor Profiles

### Browser Sandbox

Use for web workflows, research, and browser-only automation.

Controls:

- Empty browser environment.
- Domain allowlist.
- Extension and local-file restrictions where possible.
- Screenshot capture and action replay.
- Human pause and resume.

### Desktop VM

Use for GUI tasks that require a full desktop.

Controls:

- Disposable Linux VM or remote sandbox provider.
- VNC stream for observation.
- Keyboard/mouse event logging.
- No inherited host secrets.
- Kill switch.

### Shell Container

Use for code execution, test runs, and file transformations.

Controls:

- Scoped mounts only.
- Empty environment by default.
- Command allowlist for production workflows.
- CPU, memory, time, and network limits.
- Artifact export instead of broad host access.

### MCP Proxy

Use for structured tool integrations.

Controls:

- Tool allowlist.
- Per-tool credential scope.
- Schema validation.
- Rate limits.
- Audited inputs and outputs.

### Human Approval Gate

Use for high-impact or irreversible actions:

- Purchases.
- External messages.
- Deletes.
- Deployments.
- Credential changes.
- Legal, financial, medical, or identity-sensitive actions.

## Policy Defaults

The current workbench starts with:

- Human approval required.
- Kill switch armed.
- Network allowlist enabled.
- Destructive and external-send actions blocked.
- Raw secrets session-only.

## Prompt-Injection Handling

Treat web pages, emails, documents, files, and tool outputs as untrusted. A sandboxed agent can summarize them, but cannot inherit instructions from them. The Safety Auditor role should inspect external content before it affects tools, files, credentials, or outbound messages.

## Production Gates

Before real computer control is enabled:

1. Implement executor gateway authentication.
2. Add per-run approval records.
3. Add immutable audit logs.
4. Add emergency kill switch enforcement server-side.
5. Add domain/action allowlist enforcement server-side.
6. Add replayable screenshots or terminal logs.
7. Add red-team tests for prompt injection and localhost/control-plane attacks.
